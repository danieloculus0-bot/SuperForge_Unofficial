# SuperForge Unified Intelligent Suite

This branch turns the former SuperForge artifact shell into a real source tree for one manufacturing operating system.

**Branch:** `unified-intelligent-suite`

The goal is simple: one package, one context model, one audit spine, and no disconnected departmental islands.

## What is consolidated

- **MFGForge / SuperForge:** ERP-style master data, jobs, quoting, planning, operational intelligence.
- **ForgeQC:** NCR/DMR/RMA/CAR/CAPA/deviation thinking, KPI/PPM linkage, ERP report ingest, persistent audit patterns.
- **PM-Tracker:** machine register, PM task/completion behavior, failure-to-planning logic.
- **EZ Expedite:** occurrence ownership, action routing, due dates, escalation, external-system references.
- **ForgeVault:** controlled drawing/document identity, revision/version concepts, release/audit patterns.
- **EZ FAIR:** actual PDF dimension extraction, ballooning, and FAI workbook writer source is vendored into superforge/modules/.
- **EZ Methods:** Vantage-style methods master planning, drawing/PO requirement traceability, operation-level material/tool/gage/fixture readiness, GD&T-to-inspection linkage, and EZ Expedite purchasing triggers.
- **Leadership / Company Pulse:** cross-functional accountability, aggregate morale/workforce-health trends, recognition rewards, training incentives, and action closure.
- **ISO-Hungry reporting backend:** auditable conversion of approved reported-event recognition into payroll-ready earnings, approval batches, export hashes, and payment confirmation receipts.
- **Automation:** configurable event rules create assigned, due-dated workflow actions with execution receipts while controlled process rules remain deterministic.
- **BEAN:** memory/learning direction is adapted into supervised observations and improvement proposals. Learning cannot silently rewrite production logic.

## Non-negotiable architecture

### 1. Everything emits events

Business mutations publish domain events to a shared event ledger. Event IDs, parent IDs, and correlation IDs connect derived work across modules.

Examples:

- quality record -> containment action -> job risk -> supplier/PO review -> PPM snapshot
- FAI failure -> NCR review -> job hold review
- failed PM -> affected jobs -> planning/capacity -> quality risk
- late PO -> expediting -> inventory impact -> job risk
- inventory shortage -> purchasing -> job schedule -> quote material risk
- clocking error -> correction -> job-cost review -> BEAN observation
- ERP sync -> reconciliation -> tracker refresh -> intelligence review
- morale/company pulse -> leadership review -> BEAN trend comparison
- training completion -> audited recognition credit -> reward/vendor ledger
- configurable event match -> assigned action -> due date -> execution receipt

### 2. Everything is auditable

`%PROGRAMDATA%\SuperForge\audit\superforge_audit.jsonl` on Windows is append-only from the application's point of view.

Each entry contains:

- sequence
- UTC timestamp
- event ID
- correlation ID
- source and target module
- actor
- action and reason
- entity identity
- before/after snapshots and hashes where applicable
- previous entry hash
- current SHA-256 entry hash

The audit path is separate from application binaries. Normal uninstall logic should leave this operational evidence alone.

### 3. Right-click works everywhere

Every screen has a universal context launcher. Right-clicking a record adds record-aware destinations. Right-clicking empty application space opens the global module launcher.

Typical menu:

```text
Open with >
  Job Tracker
  Purchase Order Tracker
  Inventory Tracker
  Job Clocking Errors
  Quality Forge
  PM / Equipment
  Drawing / Document Vault
  EZ FAIR / FAI
  PPAP
  Quoting
  Planning / Capacity
  Supplier History
  ERP / Systems
  BEAN Intelligence
  Audit Trail
```

Context is carried in the URL and relevant tracker views resolve direct relationships instead of opening blank.

### 4. Quality is the center of gravity

Quality Forge is designed to become the strongest module in the suite, not a side page.

The shared schema supports:

- NCR
- DMR
- RMA
- CAR
- CAPA
- deviation
- inspection reject
- customer complaint
- supplier NCR
- 5-Why / corrective action
- containment
- disposition
- root cause
- corrective/preventive action
- effectiveness
- part/job/PO/supplier/machine links
- PPM
- inspections
- FAI
- PPAP
- linked evidence
- workflow actions

### 5. ERP integration is adapter-based

SuperForge does not hard-code itself to JobBOSS².

Built-in adapter contracts cover:

- CSV/JSON report-drop feeds
- REST APIs
- approved SQL/report views
- queued outbound payloads
- field mapping and transforms
- durable external IDs
- sync-run receipts
- conflicts
- retries/outbox

That architecture can support JobBOSS², Epicor, Plex, SAP, Infor/Syteline, or a custom ERP when that system exposes an approved interface. Closed proprietary systems still require whatever export/API/database access the vendor permits.

### 6. Learning is supervised

BEAN-style learning can:

- retain observations
- measure repeated signals
- retain outcomes and human ratings
- propose rule/routing/threshold improvements
- attach evidence
- require a validation plan
- require a rollback plan

It cannot silently change production rules. Proposals remain `proposal_only` until a recorded human review changes permission.


### 7. Leadership includes morale and recognition

Leadership is treated as an operating process. The Company Pulse view combines open/overdue/unassigned work, quality load, purchasing risk, blocked method dependencies, aggregate morale signals, recognition, and training.

Morale/workforce health is stored as department/period aggregates. Recognition accounts and vending/canteen references are kept in a separate positive reward ledger.

### 8. Automation must leave receipts

Configurable automation rules match domain events and create normal workflow actions with target module, assignee, due date, source event, and execution receipt.

Automation can route work aggressively. It cannot silently rewrite controlled methods, inspection criteria, quality requirements, or ERP source data.

## Run

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5060
```

## UI

- dark by default
- neutral dark surfaces
- one configurable accent color for buttons, active navigation, and subtle highlights
- optional light mode
- no multicolor carnival UI
- global and record-specific right-click navigation

## Current build status

This branch is the new unified foundation. It already contains the shared schema, event bus, audit journal, context router, ERP adapter framework, native quality services, EZ Methods, Leadership / Company Pulse, recognition and training ledgers, configurable automation, supervised learning services, and vendored EZ FAIR extraction/workbook engines.

Legacy repos remain untouched while migration continues.
